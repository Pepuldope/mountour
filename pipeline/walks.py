"""The walk from each parking spot and stop to the trail, on paths, from a local OSRM (foot profile).

The trip page draws this walk and used to ask OpenRouteService for it on every
visit (free key: 40 routes a minute). The walk is the same for everyone, so it
is worked out here once a week and stored on the parking or stop itself:

    "walk": {"line": [[lon, lat], ...], "m": 420, "min": 6}

It ends where the site joins the trail (lib/trailJoin.ts, ported below): the
trail's nearest point when that saves at least 100 m, else the trail start.

The nearest point is not always the best way in. A bus stop beside the road
can be 500 m from the start as the crow flies yet 1.2 km on paths, while a
path from the stop climbs straight up to the trail further on (Vilmošove
vodopády from Kačínska dolina). So for there-and-back trips the walk is also
measured (OSRM table) to points along the first half of the way up, and it
goes to the one that makes the whole way up clearly shorter. The site then
joins the trail where the stored walk first meets it (lib/trailJoin.ts).
