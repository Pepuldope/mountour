# Search and visitor stats: setup

What the code does on its own, and the few things only you can click. Every tool here is free.
Settings that are not secret live in `lib/site.ts` (one line each). Secrets go only into the
Cloudflare dashboard, never into the repo (it is public).

## What is built

| Piece | Where | Needs setup? |
|---|---|---|
| Slovak titles, descriptions, canonical URLs, link previews | `lib/seo.ts`, each `page.tsx` | No |
| `sitemap.xml` (home, every trip, info pages) and `robots.txt` | `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts` | No |
| Structured data (WebSite, Organization, TouristAttraction, breadcrumbs) | `components/JsonLd.tsx` | No |
| Brand icons and preview image | `app/icon.svg`, `app/apple-icon.png`, `public/og-image.png` | No |
| Privacy, disclaimer, sources pages + footer | `/sukromie`, `/upozornenie`, `/zdroje` | Optional contact e-mail |
| Umami visitor stats + product events | `components/Analytics.tsx`, `lib/analytics.ts` | **Step 1** |
| "People with 4+ visit days" counter + report at `/statistiky` | `app/api/visit`, `lib/visitStore.ts`, Cloudflare D1 | No |
| Google Search Console | outside the code | **Step 2**, after the domain |

The real address is `SITE_URL` in `lib/site.ts`. When mountour.sk is live, change that one line
to `https://mountour.sk` and add `mountour.sk` to Search Console; all canonical URLs, the sitemap
and link previews follow.

## Why two counters

Umami Cloud's free Hobby plan (100k events/month, 1 website, 6 months of history) gives the
dashboard: visitors, where they came from, which trips they opened, saves, shares and navigation
opens. It has **no API on the free plan**, so a script cannot read its numbers. The proposal KPI
"people who used MounTour on 4+ different days in a month" is therefore counted by our own small
Cloudflare D1 database (free, bound as `VISITS_DB` in `wrangler.jsonc`; the first deploy creates
it, no account, key or secret needed), with the same method Umami uses: a one-way hash of
IP + browser with a random key that changes every month. Nothing is stored on the visitor's
device, so no consent banner. When a month ends its key and raw rows are deleted and only the
totals stay. The count is conservative: someone whose phone changes IP address between days is
counted as two people with fewer days each.

**The monthly report:** open `/statistiky` on the live site (not linked, not indexed). One row
per month: people, people with 2+ days, people with **4+ days** (the KPI), average days. The
current month updates live. If the page says the counter only runs on the published site after a
deploy, check Cloudflare → **Workers & Pages** → **mountour** → **Bindings**: `VISITS_DB` should
be listed. If it is missing, the build had no permission to create the database: **Storage &
Databases** → **D1** → **Create** → name `mountour-visits`, then in the Worker → **Bindings** →
**Add binding** → **D1 database**, variable name `VISITS_DB`, database `mountour-visits` → **Save**.

## Events sent to Umami

| Event | When | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `trip_open` | a trip page is opened | `trail` (slug) |
| `trip_saved` | "Uložiť výlet" tapped | `trail` |
| `share` | plan shared with the group (call `track("share", { trail })` from the share button) | `trail` |
| `nav_open` | Google Maps / map-app link tapped | `app`: google or geo |
| `transit_open` | cp.sk link tapped | none |

Links can also be tracked with no code: add `data-umami-event="nav_open"` to the `<a>`. Never
send coordinates, typed places or anything personal.

## Step 1. Umami account (about 10 minutes)

1. Open https://cloud.umami.is/signup and create an account (Hobby plan, free, no card).
2. After logging in you are asked to add a website. If not: left menu **Settings** → **Websites** →
   **Add website**.
   - Name: `MounTour`
   - Domain: `mountour.nemcok-peter123.workers.dev`
   - Click **Save**.
3. In the website list click **Edit** next to MounTour. Copy the **Website ID** (a long code like
   `a1b2c3d4-...`).
4. Send that ID to Claude in the project thread, or put it in `lib/site.ts` yourself:
   on GitHub open `lib/site.ts` → pencil icon (**Edit this file**) → change
   `?? ""` on the `UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` line to `?? "your-id"` → **Commit changes**.
5. Optional: Settings → Team → add Radoslav, so he sees the dashboard without your login.

After the next deploy, open the site, then Umami → **Websites** → MounTour: your visit shows up
within a minute.

## Step 2. Google Search Console (after mountour.sk is live)

1. https://search.google.com/search-console → **Add property** → **Domain** → `mountour.sk` →
   **Continue**.
2. Copy the TXT record Google shows. At the DNS provider (Cloudflare, if the domain is moved
   there) → **DNS** → **Add record** → Type `TXT`, Name `@`, Content = the copied text → **Save**.
   Back in Search Console click **Verify**.
3. Left menu **Sitemaps** → enter `sitemap.xml` → **Submit**.
4. **URL inspection** → paste the home page and 2-3 trip links → **Request indexing**.
5. **Settings** → **Users and permissions** → **Add user** → Radoslav, Full.
6. Optional: https://www.bing.com/webmasters → **Import from Google Search Console**.

Before the domain exists you can already test link previews: paste a trip link into Messenger or
WhatsApp, or use https://www.opengraph.xyz, and check structured data at
https://search.google.com/test/rich-results.
