// Trip data schema, version 1. The weekly pipeline (pipeline/) writes these
// files; the site only reads them. Full description: docs/TRIP-DATA.md.
//
//   public/data/trips/index.json   TripIndex       main route of every place (server: home, sitemap, API)
//   data/trip-variants.json        TripIndex-like  the other routes of each place (database load only)
//   public/data/trips/list.json    TripList        every trip, trimmed for the home list
//   public/data/trips/<slug>.json  TripDetail      one trip with its path, parking, stops, POIs
//   public/data/drive/<town>.json  TownDriveFile   car times from one town to every trip
//   data/towns.json                Towns           the towns of the drive table
//   data/closure-rules.json        ClosureRules    hand-kept, every rule has an official source
//   data/fee-rules.json            FeeRules        hand-kept entry fees (vstupné) with sources
//   public/gpx/<slug>.gpx                          full-resolution GPX per trip
//
// Rules for consumers:
// - Never show a trip as "open" because closure_rule_ids is empty. No rule
//   means "Stav chodníka neoverený" (see README, closure rule).
// - Slugs are stable across weekly runs (pipeline/slugs.json), so they are
//   safe for URLs, saved trips and share links.
// - Every page that shows trip data must credit OpenStreetMap (attribution).
